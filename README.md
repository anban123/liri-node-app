In this assignment, I made LIRI, which is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Liri can help the user find a concert, song, or movie.  The user can enter one of four commands: "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says" and Liri will pull the pertinent information through an API via axios/npm for Bands in Town, Spotify, and OMDB. 

Liri Commands:
concert-this            node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
spotify-this-song       node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
movie-this              node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
do-what-it-says         node liri.js do-what-it-says

Below are the instructions:
-Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
-Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
-Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
-Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
-Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
-Clearly list the technologies used in the app
-State your role in the app development
